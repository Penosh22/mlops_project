Welcome to the **Laptop Fare Price Predictions** project! This repository contains the code and workflow of an MLOps project focused on predicting the prices of laptops based on various features like brand, specifications, and more. The project demonstrates the end-to-end pipeline of data collection, preprocessing, model building, deployment, and monitoring within an MLOps framework using Azure services.

## üèóÔ∏è Key Features

- **Data Collection & Storage**: 
  - Data was collected from multiple sources using web scraping and APIs.
  - Stored securely in **Azure Data Lake** for scalability and availability.
  
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Used **Azure Data Flow** for cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for modeling.
  
- **Model Training**:
  - Built and trained multiple models using **Azure Databricks**.
  - Managed experiments using **MLflow** for efficient tracking of hyperparameters and performance.
  
- **Model Deployment**:
  - Deployed the best-performing model using **Azure Web App Services** for real-time predictions.
  
- **Monitoring & Retraining**:
  - Daily monitoring of data drift using **Azure Dataflow** and **Databricks**.
  - Automated retraining pipeline to maintain high accuracy over time.
