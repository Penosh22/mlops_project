üöÄ Laptop Fare Price Prediction - MLOps Project
Welcome to the Laptop Fare Price Prediction project! This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning pipeline designed to predict the price of laptops based on various features such as brand, processor type, RAM, and more.

üìã Project Overview
In this project, we implemented an MLOps pipeline for predicting laptop prices, integrating key tools and platforms such as Azure Data Lake, Databricks, and Azure Web Apps for deployment and monitoring. The focus was on ensuring scalability, automation, and monitoring throughout the entire pipeline.

Key Features:
Data Collection: Scraped data from multiple sources and APIs.
Data Storage: Leveraged Azure Data Lake for scalable storage.
Model Training: Used Azure Databricks to develop and train the ML models.
Model Deployment: The trained model is deployed via Azure Web App Services for real-time predictions.
Monitoring: Set up model performance monitoring with MLflow and Azure Monitor to track data drift and automatically retrain models as needed.
üõ† Tech Stack
Language: Python
Cloud Platform: Microsoft Azure
Tools: Azure Data Lake, Azure Databricks, Azure Web App Services, MLflow, Python Libraries (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy)
Modeling: Supervised Learning (Regression)
üèóÔ∏è Pipeline Architecture
Data Ingestion:
Collect and store data in Azure Data Lake.
Data Preprocessing:
Data cleaning and feature engineering using Databricks.
Model Training:
Train models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees) and log experiments with MLflow.
Model Deployment:
Deploy the best model on Azure Web App Services for production.
Monitoring & Retraining:
Set up monitoring pipelines for data drift using MLflow and Azure Monitor.
